/**
 *
 * Adapter
 *
 * Real World Example
 *
 * Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card
 * and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order
 * to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is
 * compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach
 * memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is
 * an adapter. Another example would be the famous power adapter;
 * a three legged plug can't be connected to a two pronged outlet,
 * it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with
 * the two pronged outlet. Yet another example would be a translator
 * translating words spoken by one person to another.
 *
 * In plain words
 *
 * Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object
 * in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.
